To add your contributions towards opensource community and grab the oppurtunity:smiley: :smiley::smiley: 

Then lets start with this repository.


### Head down :arrow_down: :arrow_down: :arrow_down: to see how to get started with the repo and follow the guidelines :dart: :dart: :dart:


 



#### ⚠️Rules :grey_exclamation: :grey_exclamation: :smirk_cat: :smirk_cat: :smirk_cat::

✅ Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.

✅ The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.

✅ If a maintainer reports your pull request as 'spam' or 'invalid', it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

✅ If a maintainer reports behaviour that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

✅ To get a t-shirt and swags, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.
This year, the first 40,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

#### ⚠️What not to do :exclamation: :exclamation: :triumph: :triumph:

❌ PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace/optimize images)

❌ PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else’s branch/commits and making a PR)

❌ PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping

❌ Something that’s clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October
